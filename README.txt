ABOUT SENCERNAKE:

This game was created with absolutely no ill intent—on the contrary, it was a fun-filled process that strengthened friendships. I wanted to introduce the most valuable people in my life through a humorous game. Have fun playing!

Characters:

Snake (Sencer - The Chubby One): This guy is the chubbiest but also the cutest among us. We've always believed he had the potential to eat all of us. That's why I wanted to give him such a role in the game.

Apple 1 (Mehmet - The Dwarf): We call Mehmet "the dwarf" because (according to him) he's 173 cm tall. When we eat Mehmet, we gain 1 point.

Apple 2 (Ebrar - Me): I am whatever you imagine me to be, and in the game, I am the same :D. When we eat me, we gain 1 point.

Toxic Apple (Furkan - The Monkey): This friend never reads group messages, is always unaware of hangouts, or is the last to find out, and barely checks his phone (so frustrating…). When Furkan is eaten, we lose 1 point. If not eaten, Furkan disappears from the screen after 3 seconds.

Apple order: Apple 1 – Apple 2 – Toxic Apple (disappears after 3 seconds if uneaten)
